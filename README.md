To run the app please increase the maximum allowed filesize, because there is a json file for seeding some data in DB which exceeds those limits.
You can do this(if you are using IntelliJ Idea) by going to Help/Edit Custom Properties... from the main menu and add "idea.max.intellisense.filesize=3000" to the opened editor.
The app  is using "Cloudinary", so please change Your credentials in application.properties file.
Do not forget to change Your credentials for spring datasource properties also.
